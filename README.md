I'm rewriting these for both C++ and a newer version of libav which is 4.2.4-1ubuntu0.1 at the time of this writing

## Setup
This assumes you are using a linux distro with apt. 
1. required libraries for development

    sudo apt install ffmpeg libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libsdl2-dev
1. compile command 
This is a little janky. I'm still learning about C++ methods of doing things. This works for now.

    g++ main01.cpp -lavutil -lavformat -lavcodec

## Tutorial 01: Making Screencaps

### Overview
Movie files have a few basic components. First, the file itself is called a container, and the type of container determines where the information in the file goes. Examples of containers are MP4 and MKV. Next, you have a bunch of streams; for example, you usually have an audio stream and a video stream. (A "stream" is just a fancy word for "a succession of data elements made available over time".) The data elements in a stream are called frames. Each stream is encoded by a different kind of codec. The codec defines how the actual data is COded and DECoded - hence the name CODEC. Examples of codecs are H264, AAC, and MP3. Packets are then read from the stream. Packets are pieces of data that can contain bits of data that are decoded into raw frames that we can finally manipulate for our application. For our purposes, each packet contains complete frames, or multiple frames in the case of audio.

At its very basic level, dealing with video and audio streams is very easy:

    10 OPEN video_stream FROM video_stream INTO frame
    20 READ packet FROM video_stream INTO frame
    30 IF frame NOT COMPLETE GOTO 20
    40 DO SOMETHING WITH frame
    50 GOTO 20

Handling multimedia with ffmpeg is pretty much as simple as this program, although some programs might have a very complex "DO SOMETHING" step. So in this tutorial, we're going to open a file, read from the video stream inside it, and our DO SOMETHING is going to be writing the frame to a PPM file.
### Opening the File
First we have to declare some stuff. We're going to need the stdio (standard I/O) and stdlib (standard Library- has a bunch of basic stuff like strings and ints). Then we have to declare the libav libraries. Since they are C libraries and we are working in C++, we need to bring them in like below. This lets the compiler know what it needs to understand how to use these libraries.

After that, I check to see if there is a file passed to the program, and let's me know if there isn't. I'm a little slow sometimes, so, I need this or I will spend an hour one day trying to figure out why nothing is working because I didn't include a file with the command. Am I really that dumb? Yeah. Sometimes. We set it as a constant and reference to the data location.

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>

    extern "C"
    {
    #include <libavutil/opt.h>
    #include <libavcodec/avcodec.h>
    #include <libavformat/avformat.h>
    #include <libswresample/swresample.h>
    }

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        av_log_set_level(AV_LOG_QUIET);
        if (argc < 2)
        {
            fprintf(stderr, "Must include a media file\n");
            return 1;
        }
        const char *fileName = argv[1];


Before we open the file, we're going to make space for it. Here we allocate the memory for the Context. In Libav parlance, Context is the container or the thing that holds all the data about the data inside. It's how your MP3 knows it's Nine Inch Nails Head Like a Hole and 5 minutes long before it ever starts playing it.

    AVFormatContext *pFormatContext = avformat_alloc_context();

Now we actually open the Context (Container). This function takes the file that we passed it, and interprets that data into a format that Libav understands best. Then we throw in a little print function to prove that the data is actually there. The two NULLs here are stuff we don't need. If we already knew the format of the Container, then we could pass that here. Otherwise, it figures out what it can automatically. The second NULL is where you would pass a dictionary of demuxer private options. 

    avformat_open_input(&pFormatContext, fileName, NULL, NULL);
    printf("Format %s, duration %ld us\n", pFormatContext->iformat->long_name, pFormatContext->duration);

The thing is, at this point we have a bunch of data about the media, but no the actual media itself. We need to add that data into our Context struct that we already have. This next step is going to add the infomation all the audio and video streams into out Context.

    avformat_find_stream_info(pFormatContext, NULL);


If this is just audio, then it might be just a mono, single track file. It has one stream. Easy Peasy. But, it might be a video file with all the images that make up the visual, a list of surround sound tracks, and optional director's stereo track, and cast commentaries track. We won't get into the weeds with all that. We're just going to find the video data. The function above gave us a new variable in out Context nb_streams. I assume that stands for **n**um**b**er of streams. We use it like this to rotate through them.

    for (int i = 0; i < pFormatContext->nb_streams; i++)
    {
    }

While we are cycling through these, we have to check them out. This AVCodecParameters is a struct that Libav provides that hold info about the streams in Context. This gets the codepar or Libav's internal code id for the codec that matches this stream.

    AVCodecParameters *pLocalCodecParameters = pFormatContext->streams[i]->codecpar;
Now that we have the codec identified, we have to go find it out on the system. AVCodec is a struct from Libav just for codec information. We use the avcodec_find_decoder to the search the system this is running on to find codecs available.

    AVCodec *pLocalCodec = avcodec_find_decoder(pLocalCodecParameters->codec_id);
As we're cycling through the streams, we're wondering what kind of stream we have. Libav comes with a way to figure that out. Here we test for a video stream. If it is, then we'll delve a little deeper into it.
    
    if (pLocalCodecParameters->codec_type == AVMEDIA_TYPE_VIDEO)
    {
    }

Just like we created a Context for the container, we're going to do that for the codec. It's just creating a struct that Libav understands and holds all the needed information about the codec.

    AVCodecContext *pCodecContext = avcodec_alloc_context3(pLocalCodec);
Just like before, now that we have the Context, this time for the codec, we have to fill it with data.

    avcodec_parameters_to_context(pCodecContext, pLocalCodecParameters);
Now that we all the information about the codec, we have to open it. I'll be honest that I don't understand the actual process here. I just you have to do it for it to work.

    avcodec_open2(pCodecContext, pLocalCodec, NULL);
And now we get to the meat of the decoding. These next two are like before and after. Some media files are huge and you just can't open up everything all at once. So these are two little structs that holds a bit of the file as compressed and then uncompressed parts. They are buffers, you fill up the AVPacket with compressed data, then youn uncompress it to the AVFrame. You do some with that data, then you empty them and do it again with the next part.
    AVPacket *pPacket = av_packet_alloc();
    AVFrame *pFrame = av_frame_alloc();


    while (av_read_frame(pFormatContext, pPacket) >= 0)
    {
        avcodec_send_packet(pCodecContext, pPacket);
        avcodec_receive_frame(pCodecContext, pFrame);
        // printf("linesize:%d\n", pFrame->linesize[0]);
        if (pFrame->linesize[0] > 0)
        {
            printf(
                "Video Frame %c (%d) pts %ld dts %ld key_frame %d [coded_picture_number %d, display_picture_number %d]\n",
                av_get_picture_type_char(pFrame->pict_type),
                pCodecContext->frame_number,
                pFrame->pts,
                pFrame->pkt_dts,
                pFrame->key_frame,
                pFrame->coded_picture_number,
                pFrame->display_picture_number);
        }
    } 








    AVFormatContext *pFormatCtx = NULL;

    // Open video file
    if(avformat_open_input(&pFormatCtx, argv[1], NULL, 0, NULL)!=0)
        return -1; // Couldn't open file

We get our filename from the first argument. This function reads the file header and stores information about the file format in the AVFormatContext structure we have given it. The last three arguments are used to specify the file format, buffer size, and format options, but by setting this to NULL or 0, libavformat will auto-detect these.

This function only looks at the header, so next we need to check out the stream information in the file.:

    // Retrieve stream information
    if(avformat_find_stream_info(pFormatCtx, NULL)<0)
    return -1; // Couldn't find stream information

This function populates pFormatCtx->streams with the proper information. We introduce a handy debugging function to show us what's inside:

    // Dump information about file onto standard error
    av_dump_format(pFormatCtx, 0, argv[1], 0);
    Now pFormatCtx->streams is just an array of pointers, of size pFormatCtx->nb_streams, so let's walk through it until we find a video stream.
    int i;
    AVCodecContext *pCodecCtxOrig = NULL;
    AVCodecContext *pCodecCtx = NULL;

    // Find the first video stream
    videoStream=-1;
    for(i=0; i<pFormatCtx->nb_streams; i++)
    if(pFormatCtx->streams[i]->codec->codec_type==AVMEDIA_TYPE_VIDEO) {
        videoStream=i;
        break;
    }
    if(videoStream==-1)
    return -1; // Didn't find a video stream

    // Get a pointer to the codec context for the video stream
    pCodecCtx=pFormatCtx->streams[videoStream]->codec;

The stream's information about the codec is in what we call the "codec context." This contains all the information about the codec that the stream is using, and now we have a pointer to it. But we still have to find the actual codec and open it:

    AVCodec *pCodec = NULL;

    // Find the decoder for the video stream
    pCodec=avcodec_find_decoder(pCodecCtx->codec_id);
    if(pCodec==NULL) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Unsupported codec!\n");
    return -1; // Codec not found
    }
    // Copy context
    pCodecCtx = avcodec_alloc_context3(pCodec);
    if(avcodec_copy_context(pCodecCtx, pCodecCtxOrig) != 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Couldn't copy codec context");
    return -1; // Error copying codec context
    }
    // Open codec
    if(avcodec_open2(pCodecCtx, pCodec)<0)
    return -1; // Could not open codec
    Note that we must not use the AVCodecContext from the video stream directly! So we have to use avcodec_copy_context() to copy the context to a new location (after allocating memory for it, of course).
    Storing the Data
    Now we need a place to actually store the frame:

    AVFrame *pFrame = NULL;

    // Allocate video frame
    pFrame=av_frame_alloc();

Since we're planning to output PPM files, which are stored in 24-bit RGB, we're going to have to convert our frame from its native format to RGB. ffmpeg will do these conversions for us. For most projects (including ours) we're going to want to convert our initial frame to a specific format. Let's allocate a frame for the converted frame now.

    // Allocate an AVFrame structure
    pFrameRGB=av_frame_alloc();
    if(pFrameRGB==NULL)
    return -1;

Even though we've allocated the frame, we still need a place to put the raw data when we convert it. We use avpicture_get_size to get the size we need, and allocate the space manually:

    uint8_t *buffer = NULL;
    int numBytes;
    // Determine required buffer size and allocate buffer
    numBytes=avpicture_get_size(PIX_FMT_RGB24, pCodecCtx->width,
                                pCodecCtx->height);
    buffer=(uint8_t *)av_malloc(numBytes*sizeof(uint8_t));

av_malloc is ffmpeg's malloc that is just a simple wrapper around malloc that makes sure the memory addresses are aligned and such. It will not protect you from memory leaks, double freeing, or other malloc problems.
Now we use avpicture_fill to associate the frame with our newly allocated buffer. About the AVPicture cast: the AVPicture struct is a subset of the AVFrame struct - the beginning of the AVFrame struct is identical to the AVPicture struct.

    // Assign appropriate parts of buffer to image planes in pFrameRGB
    // Note that pFrameRGB is an AVFrame, but AVFrame is a superset
    // of AVPicture
    avpicture_fill((AVPicture *)pFrameRGB, buffer, PIX_FMT_RGB24,
                    pCodecCtx->width, pCodecCtx->height);

Finally! Now we're ready to read from the stream!
Reading the Data
What we're going to do is read through the entire video stream by reading in the packet, decoding it into our frame, and once our frame is complete, we will convert and save it.

    struct SwsContext *sws_ctx = NULL;
    int frameFinished;
    AVPacket packet;
    // initialize SWS context for software scaling
    sws_ctx = sws_getContext(pCodecCtx->width,
        pCodecCtx->height,
        pCodecCtx->pix_fmt,
        pCodecCtx->width,
        pCodecCtx->height,
        PIX_FMT_RGB24,
        SWS_BILINEAR,
        NULL,
        NULL,
        NULL
        );

    i=0;
    while(av_read_frame(pFormatCtx, &packet)>=0) {
    // Is this a packet from the video stream?
    if(packet.stream_index==videoStream) {
        // Decode video frame
        avcodec_decode_video2(pCodecCtx, pFrame, &frameFinished, &packet);
        
        // Did we get a video frame?
        if(frameFinished) {
        // Convert the image from its native format to RGB
            sws_scale(sws_ctx, (uint8_t const * const *)pFrame->data,
            pFrame->linesize, 0, pCodecCtx->height,
            pFrameRGB->data, pFrameRGB->linesize);
        
            // Save the frame to disk
            if(++i<=5)
            SaveFrame(pFrameRGB, pCodecCtx->width, 
                        pCodecCtx->height, i);
        }
    }
        
    // Free the packet that was allocated by av_read_frame
    av_free_packet(&packet);
    }

A note on packets
Technically a packet can contain partial frames or other bits of data, but ffmpeg's parser ensures that the packets we get contain either complete or multiple frames.

The process, again, is simple: av_read_frame() reads in a packet and stores it in the AVPacket struct. Note that we've only allocated the packet structure - ffmpeg allocates the internal data for us, which is pointed to by packet.data. This is freed by the av_free_packet() later. avcodec_decode_video() converts the packet to a frame for us. However, we might not have all the information we need for a frame after decoding a packet, so avcodec_decode_video() sets frameFinished for us when we have the next frame. Finally, we use sws_scale() to convert from the native format (pCodecCtx->pix_fmt) to RGB. Remember that you can cast an AVFrame pointer to an AVPicture pointer. Finally, we pass the frame and height and width information to our SaveFrame function.
Now all we need to do is make the SaveFrame function to write the RGB information to a file in PPM format. We're going to be kind of sketchy on the PPM format itself; trust us, it works.

    void SaveFrame(AVFrame *pFrame, int width, int height, int iFrame) {
    FILE *pFile;
    char szFilename[32];
    int  y;
    
    // Open file
    sprintf(szFilename, "frame%d.ppm", iFrame);
    pFile=fopen(szFilename, "wb");
    if(pFile==NULL)
        return;
    
    // Write header
    fprintf(pFile, "P6\n%d %d\n255\n", width, height);
    
    // Write pixel data
    for(y=0; y<height; y++)
        fwrite(pFrame->data[0]+y*pFrame->linesize[0], 1, width*3, pFile);
    
    // Close file
    fclose(pFile);
    }
We do a bit of standard file opening, etc., and then write the RGB data. We write the file one line at a time. A PPM file is simply a file that has RGB information laid out in a long string. If you know HTML colors, it would be like laying out the color of each pixel end to end like #ff0000#ff0000.... would be a red screen. (It's stored in binary and without the separator, but you get the idea.) The header indicated how wide and tall the image is, and the max size of the RGB values.
Now, going back to our main() function. Once we're done reading from the video stream, we just have to clean everything up:

    // Free the RGB image
    av_free(buffer);
    av_free(pFrameRGB);

    // Free the YUV frame
    av_free(pFrame);

    // Close the codecs
    avcodec_close(pCodecCtx);
    avcodec_close(pCodecCtxOrig);

    // Close the video file
    avformat_close_input(&pFormatCtx);

    return 0;
You'll notice we use av_free for the memory we allocated with avcode_alloc_frame and av_malloc.
That's it for the code! Now, if you're on Linux or a similar platform, you'll run:

gcc -o tutorial01 tutorial01.c -lavutil -lavformat -lavcodec -lz -lavutil -lm
If you have an older version of ffmpeg, you may need to drop -lavutil:
gcc -o tutorial01 tutorial01.c -lavformat -lavcodec -lz -lm
Most image programs should be able to open PPM files. Test it on some movie files.
